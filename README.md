**Pocket CLI** gives your AI assistant the power to actually *do things* on the internet — check emails, browse social media, get news, look up information, and more.

Think of it as hands for your AI. Instead of just chatting, your AI can now reach out and interact with real services like Twitter, YouTube, Hacker News, Wikipedia, and dozens more.

No coding required. Just install it, and your AI assistant instantly gains superpowers to help you with real tasks across the web.

## 🚀 Install

One command. That's it.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenKaiii/pocket-agent-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenKaiii/pocket-agent-cli/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Works on **macOS** (Intel & Apple Silicon), **Linux**, and **Windows**.

The installer automatically:
- Downloads the right version for your system
- Installs it globally
- Configures your PATH
- Works immediately in new terminals

To update later, just run the same command again.

## 🧠 Why this exists

AI assistants are smart but powerless. They can answer questions, but they can't actually *do* anything.

Pocket CLI changes that. It's a universal interface that lets any AI agent interact with the real world:
- Check your emails and send replies
- Send SMS via Twilio, push notifications via ntfy
- Message on Slack, Discord, Telegram
- Search YouTube, get video stats
- Browse Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter
- Look up weather, crypto prices, currency rates
- Query Wikipedia, StackOverflow, dictionaries
- Manage Todoist tasks, Notion pages, Obsidian vaults
- Control macOS apps: Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Contacts, Finder, Safari
- **72 integrations** across 10 categories

All with simple commands that return clean JSON — perfect for AI to understand and act on.
